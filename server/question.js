If they lie down too soon, the food will create pressure in the gastrointestinal tract and gastric juices will flow into the esophagus.  This fluid damages the esophagus so we need to keep them upright to avoid that.  People with GERD should avoid spicy and fatty foods as these can increase reflux.  The largest meal of the day needs to be breakfast as dinner time is close to going to sleep which can increase the risk of lying down too soon.

Clients need different things for motivation and the caregiver should tailor their response on what works best for the client."
